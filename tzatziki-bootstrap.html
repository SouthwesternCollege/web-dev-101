        <h1>Tzatzki</h1>
        <img src="assets/img/raul-tzatziki-santorini.png" alt="Raul enjoying tzatziki in Santorini">
        <p>During a summer getaway to Greece, I stumbled upon a traditional tzatziki recipe that would change my
            culinary
            world forever. Made with fresh yogurt, crisp cucumbers, and a hint of garlic, this creamy dip was the
            perfect
            accompaniment to every meal. With each bite, I could taste the sun-kissed Mediterranean flavors and imagine
            myself sitting in a quaint Greek taverna. After returning home, I couldn't wait to recreate this delicious
            dish
            and share it with my loved ones. Now, every time I make tzatziki, it takes me back to that magical vacation
            and
            reminds me of the beauty of discovering new flavors and experiences.

            <li>Stir all the ingredients together until they are well combined.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes (or up to a

                hours) to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
            <li>Serve the tzatziki chilled, garnished with additional fresh dill, if desired. Enjoy as a dip for
